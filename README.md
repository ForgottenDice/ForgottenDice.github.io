## Description
"Forgotten Dice - Calculator" is an online dice simulator for tabletop roll-playing games. 

As many players of table-top RPGs well know, showing up for game night without your dice is devestating. Asking to borrow someone else's dice can come off as ridiculous, rude, bad luck, or even heresy. Finding a good dice-app can save you embarassment or ostrasism. 

Some players even prefer the fairness of a simulation over traditional dice, while others run into situations that call for rolling an absurd number of dice at once. In both of these cases, the digital option has the advantage.

Nevertheless, finding the right app (one that is convenient, functional, free) can be a trial. Most dice apps are limited by operating system, and frequently contain ads or paywalls.

Our goal is to create a free, cross-platform, mobile-friendly dice-rolling web-app for the frequent-forgetters and the digital-minded roll-playing gamers.
